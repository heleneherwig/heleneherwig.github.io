# The Opposite of Mindfulness Is Mindlessness
Mindfulness can strengthen our ability to consciously press our mental ‘pause‘ button and take a moment to relax in our hectic society. Thus we give ourselves the possibility to perceive our thoughts, feelings and sensations. Through the realization of our needs, we can focus on the things that are important to us and appreciate ourselves and our surroundings.
By means of mindfulness in our everyday life we empower ourselves to pay more attention to and value the small things in our lives. In addition we are able to identify and reduce actions and thoughts, which may not be useful at present, and replace them with more helpful ones. Therefore we can reduce (un)conscious stress and negative thoughts and improve our quality of life. 

# 31 Exercises for More Mindfulness in Our Everyday Lives 
On the basis of a mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-course (that I attended a few months ago) and some meditation-related websites I assembled a list of mindfulness exercises. As the list progresses, the intensity of the exercises will increase. Feel free to modify or add to the list of exercises, e.g. the order in which order you want to do them. Or if you dislike a particular exercise you can skip it or replace it with another one that you like more.
> Advice: Some exercises should be done while getting up. So I would recommend having a look at the list of exercises the evening before.

2. Smile into yourself for 1 minute straight.
